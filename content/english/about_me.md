### Who i am?

My name is Luiz Felipe, I'm 20 years old, I'm a Brazilian student who has always been involved in the technology field. This passion for technology started through games, which I was introduced to very early. Nowadays I am engaged in studies in the area of ​​cybersecurity, networking and a little programming, but I have also studied hardware. I focus on studies to seek standard certifications in the future to launch myself as a professional in the field, mainly targeting the area of ​​cybersecurity.

### My pourpose with this website.

I made this website to organize and share my notes made during my periods of study, I hope these notes help someone who is following the same path as me, and also to reinforce my own knowledge, after all, when we transmit knowledge is when we really learn and reinforce our own knowledge.
